Data Visualization

Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs to visually represent the sales performance.

Clean and professional plots for better understanding.

ðŸ“Œ Insights & Recommendations
Products in the "Nest-USA" category generated the highest revenue.

Coupon usage showed no statistically significant difference in average transaction value â€” indicating a potential need to reevaluate the discount strategy.

Retention rates varied by cohort â€” suggesting targeted engagement strategies could help retain customers better in low-retention months.



ðŸ“Œ Future Scope
Integration with real-time data sources (APIs).

Predictive analytics using machine learning models.

Dashboard creation using Power BI or Tableau for stakeholders.

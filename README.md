📌 Insights & Recommendations
Products in the "Nest-USA" category generated the highest revenue.

Coupon usage showed no statistically significant difference in average transaction value — indicating a potential need to reevaluate the discount strategy.

Retention rates varied by cohort — suggesting targeted engagement strategies could help retain customers better in low-retention months.



📌 Future Scope
Integration with real-time data sources (APIs).

Predictive analytics using machine learning models.

Dashboard creation using Power BI or Tableau for stakeholders.

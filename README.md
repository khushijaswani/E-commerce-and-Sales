🛒 E-commerce & Sales Analysis
Executive Summary

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I analyzed an e-commerce dataset to evaluate sales performance, customer behavior, coupon effectiveness, and retention trends.
The analysis focused on identifying revenue-driving product categories, understanding customer value segmentation, and assessing whether discount strategies meaningfully impact purchasing behavior.

Key findings indicate that certain product categories contribute disproportionately to revenue, while coupon usage does not significantly improve average transaction value. Based on cohort and retention analysis, targeted customer engagement strategies are recommended to improve long-term retention and revenue growth.

Business Problem

E-commerce businesses must understand what drives revenue and customer retention to remain competitive.
Stakeholders want to know:

Which product categories and customer segments generate the highest revenue?

Do coupons and discounts meaningfully increase customer spend?

How well are customers retained over time, and where do drop-offs occur?

Which customers provide the highest long-term value?

The goal of this project is to convert raw transactional data into actionable business insights that can improve profitability and customer lifetime value.

Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Cleaned missing values, standardized date formats, and engineered revenue metrics.

Created customer-level features for segmentation and retention analysis.

Exploratory & Revenue Analysis

Analyzed total and monthly revenue by product category and customer segment.

Identified high-performing products and revenue trends over time.

Customer Segmentation

Classified customers into Premium, Gold, Silver, and Standard categories using score-based evaluation.

Compared revenue contribution and transaction behavior across segments.

Coupon Effectiveness Analysis

Compared average transaction values between coupon users and non-users.

Performed statistical testing (t-test) to measure the significance of coupon impact.

Cohort & Retention Analysis

Grouped customers by first purchase month.

Measured retention rates to identify strong and weak cohorts.

Data Visualization

Created clear bar charts, line plots, and cohort heatmaps for storytelling.

Results & Business Recommendations

The Nest-USA product category generated the highest overall revenue, making it a key focus area for inventory and marketing investment.

Coupon usage showed no statistically significant increase in average transaction value, suggesting the current discount strategy may be eroding margins without driving meaningful uplift.

Customer retention varied significantly across cohorts, indicating opportunities for targeted re-engagement campaigns during low-retention periods.

Premium and Gold customers contributed a disproportionately high share of revenue, highlighting the importance of loyalty-focused strategies.

Recommendations:

Optimize marketing spend toward high-revenue product categories.

Reevaluate coupon strategies and test targeted, personalized discounts instead of blanket offers.

Implement cohort-based engagement campaigns to improve retention in weaker months.

Develop loyalty programs focused on high-value customer segments.

Next Steps

Integrate real-time data sources (APIs) for live performance tracking.

Build predictive models to forecast churn and customer lifetime value.

Create an interactive Power BI / Tableau dashboard for business stakeholders.

Perform A/B testing on discount and engagement strategies.
